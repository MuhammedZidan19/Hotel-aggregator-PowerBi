# Internship Project: Hotel Aggregator Listing Analysis using Power BI

## Problem Statement
The internship project aims to analyze a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using Power BI. The dataset contains attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create comprehensive visualizations and insights that reveal trends, patterns, and factors influencing listing performance. Interns will explore key metrics like pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for improving listing quality and competitiveness.

## Dataset Description
- Attributes include id, listing_url, scrape_id, last_scraped, source, name, description, neighborhood_overview, picture_url, host_id, and more capturing details about hosts, location, property type, room details, amenities, pricing, availability, and reviews.

## Project Objectives
1. **Geographical Insights:** Visualize listing distribution on a map to identify popular neighborhoods and explore geographical concentration.
2. **Pricing and Availability Analysis:** Analyze pricing trends based on property and room types, accommodation capacity, and investigate listing availability over time.
3. **Host Performance:** Evaluate host characteristics such as superhost status, response times, and verification methods, and explore correlations with listing performance.
4. **Review Scores and Guest Satisfaction:** Examine review scores and their impact on listing performance, identifying areas for improvement based on specific review categories.
5. **Property Type and Room Analysis:** Analyze distribution of property and room types and explore trends in accommodation preferences.

## Deliverables
- Interactive Power BI dashboards illustrating geographical distribution, pricing trends, host characteristics, and review scores.
- Reports on availability patterns, property and room preferences, and factors influencing guest satisfaction.
- Recommendations for hosts and the aggregator platform based on the analysis.
